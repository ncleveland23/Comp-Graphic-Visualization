# What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
# What design process did you follow for your project work?
# How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
Working with matrices to create different objects in a 3D enviroment within a window on a computer is something I never thought I could do. To be able to figure out and troubleshoot and debug the code gave me confidence to apply that to other projects in the future. Working on this project has also helped me with the use of functions to do specific tasks and how i can work on using these functions to not write duplicate code. 

# What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
When working on this project, I have foiund that typing out code that is given to us instead of copy and pasting it helps me to understand what the code is do and comprehending it better.

# How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration helped to see the different step coming together to complete the overall scene. They helped to see how each part worked with one another to come togther to display the different object. It gives you a better understanding of what each thing does. 

# How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
Each milestone helped to give more detail to the scene. From the first step that involved having two shaopes displayed together to create one object to adding a plane for the objects to lay on. Then positioning the objects in the scene with the layout  to match the scene. 

# How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
Computation graphics and visualization helped me to focus on the little details within a project. The details in postioning the objects in the scene to a while to test but overall came out the way it was intended. 

# How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
Computation graphics and visualization helped me to think that I could see myself working on developing games and creating things with code for others to enjoy.
